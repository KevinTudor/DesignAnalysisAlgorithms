# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

### Technology

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots.
* [Quicksort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/): a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer approach where an array is divided into subarrays by selecting a pivot element (element selected from the array).

### [QuickSort_Python](QuickSort/QuickSort_Python.py)
- Use Quicksort algorithm to sort sequences based off pseudocode, analyze computational running time for used partition methods and include [code/report](QuickSort/Quicksort_Report.pdf).

### [BST_Python](BinarySearchTree/BST_Python.py)
- The primary purpose of this code is to demonstrate the operations of insertion, deletion, and searching in a BST and provide visual representations of these operations for educational or debugging purposes. The visualizations help in understanding how these operations affect the structure of the BST.
